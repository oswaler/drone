At this point I am interested in what you think of the tone and what you think of the graphics. If your Echo device does not have a screen you can look at the home page in the Alexa app. \n \n This skill plays the pitch you request in a natural tone. Instead of computer beeps the tone is played on a viola recorded in a studio, so it is easy to listen to has the overtones of a natural instrument. The tone will play until you tell Alexa to stop. \n \n You can request any scale note. In addition to the utterances above, you can say things like: \n \n Alexa, ask Pitch Drone to give me a C double sharp. \n or \n Alexa, ask Pitch Drone for an A440. \n \n When finished, say: \n Alexa, Stop \n or: \n Alexa, shut up",
