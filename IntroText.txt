Thanks for doing this. This skill is a drone app that does a few things differently than the others


1) Most importantly, the tones it plays are recorded in a sound studio by a professinal violist. We use natural tones with the overtones of a real instrument, not computer beeps
2) The tone will play as long as you want.


During this first round of testing, the only note that works is B. I am interested right now in:
1)What you think of the tone. Is it suitable for long practice sessions?
2What do you think of the graphics? If your Echo device doesn't have a screen, you can see them in the Alexa app.
3)You can ask specifically for an A440


To use the skill you can say
"Alexa, Open Pitch Drone" - you will be prompted for the note you want
"Alexa, Ask Pitch Drone to give me a B" - It will play a B and show a graphic on the home screen of the Alex app
"Alexa, Ask Pitch Drone for a B" - same - plays the tone and shows graphic


To stop the tone say
"Alexa, Stop"
or 
"Alexa, Shut Up"

Once Alexa stops another graphic will display on your screen or in the Alexa app.
